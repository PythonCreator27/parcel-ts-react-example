# React with Parcel (without CRA, Next.js, etc.)

This is a react app using React 18 Alpha, Parcel 2 nightly, TailwindCSS (2.2) JIT, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and React Router 5. As you can tell, it uses some pretty unstable software...

# Usage

Install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn
# OR
npm i
```

Dev server:

```bash
yarn dev
# OR
npm run dev
```

Build:

```bash
yarn build
# OR
npm run build
```

That's it! And to deploy, you can use Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, or any static host (as of now, SSR will be added later).
